      formula: "θ = tan⁻¹(n₂/n₁)",
      siunit: "degree",
      process: `"θ = tan⁻¹(n₂/n₁)" This equation is known as Brewster's law, where 'θ' is a brewster's angle, 'n₁' is the refractive index of the first media through which light propagates (the "incidental medium"), and 'n₂' is the index of the other medium, and we can simply get the angle by plugging these numbers into the equation.`,
      details: `The reflected light will be linearly polarised if light strikes an interface at a 90ᴼ angle between the reflected and refracted rays. The polarisation direction (the direction in which the electric field vectors point) is parallel to the interface plane.
               The Brewster angle, θ., is a unique incidence angle that results in a 90ᴼ angle between the reflected and refracted rays. A quick calculation reveals that tan(θ) = n₂/n₁.`,

      the ratio of sine of angle of Incidence to the sine of angle of Refraction.Snell's Law describes how light bends when traveling from one medium to the next.`,

      details: `The change in direction or bending of a light wave passing from one transparent medium to another caused by the change in wave’s speed is the Refraction.The laws of refraction hold good at every point on the spherical surface.The study of refraction at single spherical surface paves way to the understanding of thin lenses which consist of two surfaces of which one or both must be spherical.`,
